"""The shard-export contract between training engines and the sharded delta engine.

``BaseEngine.get_per_tensor_param_shard`` yields ``(name, local_shard, ShardSpec)``
per local parameter, in an order identical on every rank. The spec describes the
parameter's distribution declaratively with torch's own vocabulary -- a
:class:`~torch.distributed.device_mesh.DeviceMesh` plus
:class:`~torch.distributed.tensor.placement_types.Placement` per mesh dim -- and
the engine derives everything else (this rank's flat offset, the gather group,
whether this rank contributes) via ``compute_local_shape_and_global_offset``.
DTensor-based trainers (FSDP, veomni, ...) pass ``param.device_mesh`` /
``param.placements`` verbatim; ``mesh=None`` means the local tensor already is
the whole parameter (replicated / unsharded).

``BaseEngine.get_per_tensor_param_delta_shard`` is the delta engine's single
export entry and yields FINAL HF-coordinate payloads: the weight->HF naming,
the to-HF conversion, the diff and its snapshot are all the backend's business
(a backend may already hold a previous-step checkpoint, e.g. Decoupled PPO, and
diff against that); the delta engine only gathers, buckets and ships. This
module stays purely declarative -- the converter-agnostic execution helpers
live in :mod:`verl.workers.engine.utils` (``hf_delta_export`` /
``prime_delta_snapshots``), and backend-specific converters ride the specs.

``to_hf_chunk`` + ``hf_slots`` describe trainers whose logical parameter differs
from the HF tensor(s) (e.g. veomni's fused expert stacks): a dim-0-separable
converter plus its static output enumeration. Both are None for identity params
(local coordinates translate straight into HF coordinates).
