    The inheritance from BaseConfig provides omegaconf.DictConfig-like interface for a dataclass config.

    Backend-specific knobs (e.g. mbridge options for Megatron) live on subclasses
    under ``verl/workers/config/checkpoint.py``. Keep this base class limited to
    fields every backend understands.

    Args:
        save_contents (list[str]): What to include in saved checkpoints.
            Options: 'model', 'optimizer', 'extra', 'hf_model'.
        load_contents (list[str]): Contents to load from checkpoint. Defaults to same as save_contents.
        async_save (bool): Whether to save checkpoints asynchronously. Only implemented for Megatron as of now.
        strict (bool): Whether to perform strict validation during weight export
        save_lora_only (bool): When True and the model has LoRA adapters, only
            save LoRA adapter weights instead of the full model state dict.
            Dramatically reduces checkpoint size (e.g. ~150 MiB vs ~54 GiB for a
            27B model). Loaded LoRA-only checkpoints are auto-detected and merged
            into the current model state. Has no effect when the model has no LoRA
            adapters.
