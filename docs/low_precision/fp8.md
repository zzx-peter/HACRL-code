# FP8 RL in verl

Last updated: 03/05/2026

verl supports two FP8 modes for accelerating RL training:

| Mode | Training Precision | Rollout Precision |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **FP8 Rollout Only** | BF16 | FP8 |
| **FP8 End-to-End** | FP8 (Megatron) | FP8 (vLLM) |

## FP8 Rollout Only

FP8 rollout-only mode keeps training in BF16 and quantizes rollout inference to FP8. This reduces GPU memory during generation and speeds up rollout without affecting training precision.

### Implementation

We monkey patch several vLLM functions to enable FP8 rollout for reinforcement learning:

1. **Quantize weights**: Quantize model weights on-the-fly from higher-precision formats to FP8.
2. **Process weights after loading**: For vLLM, we replace the `vllm.model_executor.layers.quantization.fp8.Fp8LinearMethod.process_weights_after_loading` function to handle weight processing after quantization. For SGLang, this patch is not needed as it natively supports loading quantized weights.

### Support Matrix

- FP8 blockwise quantization for rollout
  - Used in Deepseek, which is 1x128 quantization for activations and 128x128 quantization for model weights
- Dense models and MoE models
- Async rollout interfaces
- vLLM 0.10.x & vLLM 0.11 & vLLM 0.12 & SGLang 0.5.5
- FSDP and Megatron training backends

### Usage

Enable in config file:

```yaml
rollout:
  quantization: "fp8"
```

Or via command line:

```bash
actor_rollout_ref.rollout.quantization=fp8
```

#### Skipping layers in SGLang FP8 rollout

When using SGLang FP8 rollout, you can skip FP8 weight quantization for
selected modules. Skipped modules stay in the rollout model dtype instead
of being converted to FP8. This is useful for layers that are not
compatible with block-wise FP8 weight quantization, or for modules that
you prefer to keep in higher precision.

Set `SGLANG_FP8_IGNORED_LAYERS` before starting training:

```bash
SGLANG_FP8_IGNORED_LAYERS=linear_attn \
python3 -m verl.trainer.main_ppo \
  actor_rollout_ref.rollout.name=sglang \
  actor_rollout_ref.rollout.quantization=fp8 \
  ...
```

Multiple entries can be separated by commas:

```bash
SGLANG_FP8_IGNORED_LAYERS=linear_attn,visual
```

You can also use the model `quantization_config`:

```json
{
  "quantization_config": {
    "ignored_layers": ["re:.*linear_attn.*"]
  }
}
```

Plain module names, full module paths, and `re:` regex patterns are
supported. verl applies the same ignored-layer rules when launching
SGLang and when syncing updated actor weights into the rollout engine.

*dark green: BF16, orange: FP8 rollout + token-level TIS, light green: FP8 rollout without TIS*

Results and observations:
- With TIS, FP8 rollout aligns with BF16
- Obvious accuracy drop when TIS is not enabled
- Higher mismatch kl but within acceptable range throughout the training

*green: BF16, orange: FP8 rollout + CUDA12.6 + DeepGemm, purple: FP8 rollout + CUDA 12.9 + DeepGemm*

Results and observations:
- FP8 rollout leads to around ~12% rollout speedup with CUDA 12.6 + DeepGemm

## FP8 End-to-End (Training + Rollout)

FP8 E2E applies FP8 to the entire RL pipeline: forward/backward passes via Transformer Engine, FP8 optimizer states, and FP8 rollout inference via vLLM. This maximizes memory savings and throughput.

### Requirements

- **CUDA 12.9+** (required for block-wise FP8 scaling)
- **Transformer Engine** with block-wise FP8 support
- Environment variable: `NVTE_FP8_BLOCK_SCALING_FP32_SCALES=1`

### Key Configuration

```yaml
# FP8 training via Transformer Engine
actor_rollout_ref.actor.megatron.override_transformer_config:
  fp8: "hybrid"              # FP8 forward + backward; also supports "e4m3"
  fp8_recipe: "blockwise"    # block-wise scaling

# FP8 optimizer
actor_rollout_ref.actor.optim.override_optimizer_config:
  fp8_recipe: "blockwise"

# FP8 rollout inference (vLLM)
actor_rollout_ref.rollout:
  quantization: fp8
```

### Support Matrix

- Megatron training backend (via Megatron-Bridge)
- Verified on Qwen3-30B-A3B and Qwen3-8B
- Block-wise FP8 scaling (`fp8_recipe: "blockwise"`)

### Experiments and Results

#### Qwen3-30B-A3B MoE Model

**Configuration**
- DAPO recipe. AIME24 online validation.
- Megatron + Megatron-Bridge, FP8 async rollout with vLLM
- MoE router in BF16 for both vLLM and Megatron-Core
- Prompt batch size 128, n=16
- Max response length 20K
- Token-level TIS, C=2
- 2\*8*H100, CUDA 12.9

![Qwen3-30b-a3b_fp8_e2e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70fb1396-ec73-40d7-9a43-1d48553c0ad9)
*Orange: BF16, Green: FP8 E2E, Red: FP8 rollout + BF16 training*

Results and observations:
- FP8 E2E achieves comparable accuracy to the BF16 baseline, with the two curves closely aligned throughout training.
- The training/inference precision mismatch (measured by KL divergence) follows the ordering: FP8 rollout-only > FP8 E2E > BF16 E2E. This is expected, as FP8 E2E maintains consistent precision across both training and inference, resulting in lower distribution mismatch than the FP8 rollout-only setting where training remains in BF16.
