RL(HF) algorithms with LoRA Support
===========================================

Last updated: 02/03/2026.

We support LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for reinforcement learning algorithms such as PPO, GRPO, and others.

LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that injects trainable low-rank matrices into pre-trained weights (typically linear layers). This reduces memory footprint and compute cost, making it possible to fine-tune large models with limited hardware.

The benefits this brings include:

- reinforcement learning with very large models (e.g. 70B+) with modest hardware (e.g. 8x80G GPUs),
- enable larger batch sizes due to reduced memory usage,
- simplify model transfer and deployment, as only LoRA adapters need to be saved,
- Combine with techniques like `SLoRA <https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03285>`_ or `CCoE <https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11686>`_ to serve multiple LoRA adapters efficiently

This guide explains how to enable LoRA in RL training and configure related parameters.

FSDP Backend Usage Guide
------------------------

.. note::

   This section applies to **FSDP/FSDP2 backend only**. For Megatron backend, see the :ref:`megatron-lora` section below.

1. Lora is available in the `verl.trainer.ppo.ray_trainer.RayPPOTrainer`. Examples are provided via the `verl.trainer.main_ppo` entry point.

2. LoRA is supported via huggingface peft with fsdp/fsdp2 and both vllm and sglang rollout backends.

- `strategy=fsdp` or `strategy=fsdp2`
- `rollout.name=vllm` or `rollout.name=sglang`

3. Required configurations for LoRA:

- `actor_rollout_ref.model.lora_rank`: int, set to a reasonable value greater than 0 (e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64)
- `actor_rollout_ref.model.lora_alpha`: float, the alpha term in LoRA
- `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.load_format="safetensors"`: required. This enables vLLM to load the base model.
- `actor_rollout_ref.model.target_modules`: the target modules for LoRA. Typically set to "all-linear".

4. Optional configurations for LoRA:

- `actor_rollout_ref.model.lora_adapter_path`: string, path to a pretrained LoRA adapter directory. 
   If provided, loads existing adapter instead of creating new one. Enables multi-stage training from previously saved adapters.
   Directory need contain `adapter_model.safetensors` and `adapter_config.json`.
- `actor_rollout_ref.model.lora.merge`: bool, whether to merge LoRA adapters into the base model weights before transferring to the rollout engine (vLLM or SGLang).
   If True, LoRA adapters are merged into base weights and full merged weights are synced. If False, only LoRA adapter deltas are transferred natively.
   For SGLang, ``merge=True`` is currently required. Native adapter loading (``merge=False``) for SGLang is planned.

5. Recommend options:

- `actor_rollout_ref.model.use_shm=True`: preload the model into `/dev/shm` to improve model loading speed.
- `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.layered_summon=True`: this enables the actor-model to gather the FSDP shards per layers when synchronizing the LoRA Adapter to vLLM, thereby reducing GPU peak memory. Recommended if the model is very large (70B+) or the GPU memory is limited (< 48GB)

Megatron Backend Usage Guide
----------------------------

.. warning::

   The FSDP-specific config options are **NOT applicable** to Megatron backend, and they will be ignored if set. Only options listed under ``lora`` key are applicable:

   - ``actor_rollout_ref.model.lora.*``
   - ``critic.model.lora.*``

You need to install and enable Megatron-Bridge for Megatron LoRA support.

Make sure you use Megatron-Bridge later than 0.2.0, and we recommended using 0.5.0 or later for proper support, and use the following settings to enable Megatron-Bridge:

- ``actor_rollout_ref.actor.megatron.use_mbridge=True``
- ``actor_rollout_ref.actor.megatron.vanilla_mbridge=False``

**Key Differences from FSDP LoRA:**

1. **LoRA Implementation**: Verl Megatron backend uses Megatron-Bridge's native LoRA implementation, which differs from HuggingFace PEFT.

2. **Weight Sync / Refit Mechanism**: Currently, Megatron-Bridge can support syncing weights by either merging LoRA adapters into the base model weights before transferring to vLLM (for better inference speed but more refit time and potential precision loss), as well as loading separate adapters.

**Configuration for Megatron LoRA:**

.. code-block:: yaml

        # whether to sync weights / refit by either merging LoRA adapters into the base model weights before transferring to vLLM (for better inference speed but more refit time and potential precision loss). If this is False, it will load separate adapters.
        merge: False

        # For fused LoRA, Defaults to all linear layers ['linear_qkv', 'linear_proj', 'linear_fc1', 'linear_fc2'].
        # For canonical LoRA: ["linear_q", "linear_k", "linear_v", "linear_proj", "linear_fc1_up", "linear_fc1_gate", "linear_fc2"]

        # - 'linear_fc1': Apply LoRA to the first fully-connected layer in MLP
        # - 'linear_fc2': Apply LoRA to the second fully-connected layer in MLP
        # Target modules can also contain wildcards. For example, you can specify
        # target_modules=['*.layers.0.*.linear_qkv', '*.layers.1.*.linear_qkv'] to add LoRA to only linear_qkv on the first two layers
        # 
        # Note:
        # For MLA (e.g., DeepSeek), you should use ["linear_kv_down_proj","linear_kv_up_proj","linear_q_down_proj","linear_q_up_proj","linear_q_proj"]
        # Instead of "linear_qkv" or ["linear_q","linear_k","linear_v"]
        # By default, MoE routers are excluded from LoRA adaptation, and you will need to specify "router" in target_modules to include them.

Best Practices and Notes
-------------------------

1. **Learning rate**: it is recommended to increase the value of learning rate by an order of magnitude.

2. **LoRA Rank**:

- Too small a rank can hurt convergence.
- LoRA rank recommendation from @thelongestusernameofall:

  - A very small lora_rank can lead to slower convergence or worse training performance. It is recommended to set lora_rank to be>=32. Tests have shown that for a 0.5B model, with lora_rank=32,the training convergence speed and final performance are almost identical to non-LoRA training
  - For a 32B model,with lora_rank=128,the training convergence speed and final performance are also almost identical to non-LoRA training.
  - More comprehensive reference results are coming soon.
