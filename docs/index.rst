Welcome to verl's documentation!
================================================

verl is a flexible, efficient and production-ready RL training framework designed for large language models (LLMs) post-training. It is an open source implementation of the `HybridFlow <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19256>`_ paper.

verl is flexible and easy to use with:

- **Easy extension of diverse RL algorithms**: The hybrid programming model combines the strengths of single-controller and multi-controller paradigms to enable flexible representation and efficient execution of complex Post-Training dataflows. Allowing users to build RL dataflows in a few lines of code.

- **Seamless integration of existing LLM infra with modular APIs**: Decouples computation and data dependencies, enabling seamless integration with existing LLM frameworks, such as PyTorch FSDP, Megatron-LM, vLLM and SGLang. Moreover, users can easily extend to other LLM training and inference frameworks.

- **Flexible device mapping and parallelism**: Supports various placement of models onto different sets of GPUs for efficient resource utilization and scalability across different cluster sizes.

- Ready integration with popular HuggingFace models


verl is fast with:

- **State-of-the-art throughput**: By seamlessly integrating existing SOTA LLM training and inference frameworks, verl achieves high generation and training throughput.

- **Efficient actor model resharding with 3D-HybridEngine**: Eliminates memory redundancy and significantly reduces communication overhead during transitions between training and generation phases.

Please check out our `project roadmap <https://github.com/verl-project/verl/issues/710>`_ and `good first issues <https://github.com/verl-project/verl/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22>`_ to see where you can contribute.

Code Linting and Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use pre-commit to help improve code quality. To initialize pre-commit, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install

To resolve CI errors locally, you can also manually run pre-commit by:

.. code-block:: bash

   pre-commit run

Adding CI tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If possible, please add CI test(s) for your new feature:

1. Find the most relevant workflow yml file, which usually corresponds to a ``hydra`` default config (e.g. ``ppo_trainer``, ``ppo_megatron_trainer``, ``sft_trainer``, etc).
2. Add related path patterns to the ``paths`` section if not already included.
3. Minimize the workload of the test script(s) (see existing scripts for examples).

We are HIRING! Send us an `email <mailto:haibin.lin@bytedance.com>`_ if you are interested in internship/FTE opportunities in MLSys/LLM reasoning/multimodal alignment.
